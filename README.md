# Boss Fight Reflection

### Did you get inspiration from a boss from another game? If so, which game? (Minimum 1 Sentence)

No, I did not get inspiration from another game. 

### Did you find it easy to create your own mechanics? Which boss mechanics were the easiest to implement? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

No, creating mechanics was pretty difficult because I had to think about how to implement my ideas. The boss mechanics which were easiest to implement were the bloody collision with the player and spinning projectiles. 

### What was the hardest part of this project? What did you do to help you get past this part? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

The hardest part was finding a playable difficulty because sometimes coding simpler just spams the same projectiles but isnâ€™t complex. I got past this by looking at other mechanics that the player had and think about how to give the boss similar movement and throwing mechanics.

### Debugging is an important part of the iterative design process. Describe a bug you encountered and how you went about fixing it. (Minimum 4 Sentences)


A bug I encountered was my sprites glitching or not delaying bullets for fireballs correctly. My player health would deplete too fast and the player would disappear off the map. My sprites had weird bugs for how far the player was in range from the boss. I also had to look back on the documents to find ways to realign my boss sprite because the shield one and the panda were different sizes and sometimes glitched into walls.
